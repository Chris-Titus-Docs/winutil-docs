   TODO:
   Make a documentation entry on Automation, and link it in the description of Install Tab, and other places that mention Automation System in this section.
-->

The Install Tab is a GUI Panel that allows users to install, remove, and update apps with ease, all with a few clicks! Not only that, but the Install Tab is used by the Automation System of WinUtil <!-- Documentation Needed, provide a link for Automation System -->.
