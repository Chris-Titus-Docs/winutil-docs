MicroWin is our in-house solution for customized and debloated Windows images. With MicroWin, you can create images that have minimal bloat and no interruptions. This has an upside: you can get more done and use Windows the way **you** want.

Due to MicroWin using standard Windows system administration tools, such as DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management), advanced Windows users (system administrators and tech enthusiasts) can continue making changes so that they can have their own set of customizations with their ISO files.

If you're excited to try this out, let's go through how to use it. You'll be done in a short time!

## Basic usage

To start with MicroWin, go to its tab. You will see the following:

From this screen, you'll have to do one of the following:

- **Select the ISO file:** if you have already downloaded a Windows ISO file, select it and click OK
- **Get an ISO file automatically:** if you don't have an ISO file ready, and don't want to waste time going to the download page, you can grab the latest versions of Windows easily. Select your preferred version and the language of the ISO file, and its destination, and you will have an ISO file in no time.
