    "content": "MicroWin is our in-house solution for customized and debloated Windows images. With MicroWin, you can create images that have minimal bloat and no interruptions. This has an upside: you can get more done and use Windows the way you want.\nDue to MicroWin using standard Windows system administration tools, such as DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management), advanced Windows users (system administrators and tech enthusiasts) can continue making changes so that they can have their own set of customizations with their ISO files.\nIf you‚Äôre excited to try this out, let‚Äôs go through how to use it. You‚Äôll be done in a short time!\nBasic usage To start with MicroWin, go to its tab. You will see the following:\nFrom this screen, you‚Äôll have to do one of the following:\nSelect the ISO file: if you have already downloaded a Windows ISO file, select it and click OK Get an ISO file automatically: if you don‚Äôt have an ISO file ready, and don‚Äôt want to waste time going to the download page, you can grab the latest versions of Windows easily. Select your preferred version and the language of the ISO file, and its destination, and you will have an ISO file in no time. [!INFO] When downloading your ISO file, network conditions (such as speed and location) can affect the time you have to wait for the download to complete and the availability of such download.\nCompatibility You may be wondering if your Windows image is compatible with the MicroWin process. Because of this, we present to you a compatibility list:\nVersion Compatible? Windows 7 ‚ùå Not supported Windows 8 ‚ùå Not supported Windows 8.1 ‚ùå Not supported Windows 10 ‚ÑπÔ∏è Only the latest versions are supported, and you will not get the full experience Windows 11 üëç Supported (21H2-24H2) After getting information about your ISO file, you will see the following screen:\nRequirements To successfully use MicroWin with your Windows image, you need the following:\nThe latest versions of Windows 10, or Windows 11 Enough space. We recommend having, at least, double the size of your ISO file. However, you may need more if you want to inject drivers Options Choosing your index By default, MicroWin will target the Pro edition of Windows. The Pro edition is a good baseline for IT administrators and end-users, due to the inclusion of Group Policy, the ability to join domains, and more things that you can‚Äôt find with the Home edition. For more information, check out this comparison chart.\nObviously, you should pick the edition of Windows for which you have a license. To change the edition to process, select the drop-down menu under ‚ÄúChoose Windows SKU‚Äù and select your edition.\nInjecting drivers If you want to use MicroWin on a real system, you may want to include the drivers for it, to avoid setting them up after OS installation. That‚Äôs where the options to inject drivers come in handy.\nInjecting drivers: if you want to install MicroWin on another system, simply check this option. Prepare a folder with the drivers of your system and specify it in the UI. To learn more about how to export the drivers, read the section ‚ÄúExporting drivers‚Äù Importing drivers: if you want to install MicroWin on your system, you can apply the drivers of your system to the image by importing them. Combine that with the former option, and you can have your driver files stored permanently on your preferred location Of course, you can continue without setting up drivers. Simply leave the options blank and continue with the process.\nHow do I export drivers? To export the drivers, you can do the following on many utilities:\nDISM To export the drivers using DISM (via the command-line), do the following:\nLaunch the command-line interpreter you want (cmd, PowerShell‚Ä¶) as an administrator Go to where you want to place the drivers with cd, and create a directory called ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù (md drivers) Run the following command: dism /online /export-driver /destination=\"\u003cpath-to-folder\u003e\" Wait for the drivers to be exported Driver Store Explorer (RAPR) To export the drivers using Driver Store Explorer (RAPR), do the following:\nGo to ‚ÄúFile \u003e Export All Drivers‚Äù Choose the folder to export all the drivers to and click OK DISM++ To export the drivers using DISM++, do the following:\nSelect your active installation if you haven‚Äôt (it‚Äôs the first item) Go to ‚ÄúDrivers‚Äù, select ‚ÄúAll‚Äù and select ‚ÄúExport‚Äù Choose the folder to export all the drivers to and click OK DISMTools To export the drivers using DISMTools, do the following:\nSelect ‚ÄúManage online installation‚Äù in the home screen and accept the warning Go to ‚ÄúCommands \u003e Drivers \u003e Export driver packages‚Ä¶‚Äù Choose the path to export the drivers to (‚ÄúExport target‚Äù) and click OK Other UIs To export the drivers using another UI, read its documentation.\nCopying to Ventoy If you have a Ventoy drive, you can copy your ISO file to it quickly and easily. This is done after it has been created. To do this, simply check ‚ÄúCopy to Ventoy‚Äù.\nYou can learn more about Ventoy drives here.\nSetting up a custom user If you want to set up a custom user, effectively creating a completely unattended installation, you can set up a user name and password:\n[!INFO] To set up a custom user, you need to specify its name, which cannot surpass 20 characters. Otherwise, a user named ‚ÄúUser‚Äù will be created. However, you don‚Äôt need to set up a password. If you leave the password box blank, you can take advantage of auto-logons, but do what you think it‚Äôs best for your use case.\nAfter configuring all your desired settings, click ‚ÄúStart the process‚Äù and specify the location of your ISO file.\nNow, you have to wait for the magic to happen. This can take between 5-10 minutes, but it depends on the performance of your computer.",
